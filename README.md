To see the demo you need two browsers, or two windows or two tabs.

   - Enter different login names in Username field and click login.
   - It will show you an array of theater seats.
   - On selecting a seat in one tab will mark it as green color, simultaneously that seat will turn red in another tab indicating the seat already booked by some other user.
